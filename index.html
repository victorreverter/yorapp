              <h3>Why YOR is your app?</h3>
              <p>YOR could be your app because in an sport life not all is about training. We have to get other cautions for get a better and long life as a runner.</p>
              <p>YOR means your other race, that invisible or not that allows you to become a better runner.</p>
              <p>Every runner hears talk about rest, feeding and good training practices, but very few apply it.</p>
              <p>With this application comes the idea of carrying out more than our passion, that is something beyond simply running.</p>
              <p>So we hope to leave you in good hands and enjoy what we offer, to continue enjoying the sport and how beautiful it is to incorporate it into our lives.</p>

              <p>Sport nutrition, by definition, is the study and practice of nutrition and diet that refers to sports performance.</p>
              <p>Sports nutrition plays a vital role in promoting athletic success, as it helps athletes to stay healthy optimally, feeding to maximize their preparation and adaptation.</p>
              <p>Athletes who train properly need to feed properly to see maximum results.</p>
              <p>The important thing is not just the types of food an athlete consumes; The number of times you eat during the day also has an impact on your performance levels and on your body's ability to recover after exercise.</p>
              <p>Meals consumed before and after exercise are the most important in sports nutrition. As a general rule, athletes should eat about two hours before exercising.</p>
              <p>This meal should be high in carbohydrates, low in fat and moderate in protein. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy that exercise requires, and proteins help in muscle growth and repair.</p>
              <p>The proportions of proteins and carbohydrates required will vary depending on the intensity and type of sport being practiced.</p>
              <p>The amount of fat that is ingested also has an impact on sports performance: it is advisable to cut the percentage of body fat in the process of sports training.</p>

              <p>One factor to consider is that athletes or active people, tend to take care of their food and therefore, have much more appetite than sedentary people.</p>
              <p>This intake of healthy foods involves nutrients of excellent quality and a large number of vitamins and minerals essential for health.</p>
              <p>It is true that vitamins do not provide energy, but they are fundamental in sports, since many are often involved in energy metabolism.</p>
              <p>Therefore, you will have a brief description of some of them and the recommended daily amount.</p>
              <p>Vitamin B1, also known as thiamin, plays a key role in energy metabolism because it helps break down carbohydrates to convert them into energy and thereby improve psychophysical performance. Thiamin is present in meats, cereals (wheat, oats and brown rice), potatoes, legumes and yeast. It is recommended to consume 1.1mg daily.</p>
              <p>Vitamin B2, also called riboflavin, is important for cellular development and respiration. It is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, vitamins and proteins, and is present in egg white, milk, cereals and fresh vegetables. It is recommended to consume 1.4mg daily.</p>
              <p>Vitamin B12 is important for supplying oxygen to tissues and is only present in products of animal origin, such as meat, cheese, milk, seafood and fortified cereals. Vegetarian and vegan athletes tend to suffer from anemia because they do not consume these foods, so they should resort to vitamin B12 supplements. It is advisable to consume 2.5mcg daily.</p>
              <p>Ascorbic acid, known as vitamin C, is water soluble and helps strengthen the immune system. It also protects the body against possible infections and is necessary for proper performance of enzymes, which are responsible for breaking down food to take advantage of its nutrients.</p>
              <p>This acid increases resistance against free radicals and can be found in tomatoes, citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwis and potatoes. It is advised to consume 80mg daily.</p>
              <p>In the diet of athletes, vitamins, proteins, minerals and hydrates are of paramount importance, especially those of the B complex and vitamin C. Therefore, do not forget to incorporate the foods that contain them to enjoy Of good health.</p>

              <p>Some sports people do not consider fruits in sports because they have actually been told that carbohydrates or proteins are important, and because fruits do not have precisely many proteins they do not consume them. However, athletes also have to think about fruit as part of their diet as they have interesting properties for the sport.</p>
              <p>To begin with, fruits have a good amount of vitamins, carbohydrates and nutrients that can be good for the sport and that also contribute a greater energy. It is a good dessert and a good way to get hydration to the body.</p>
              <p>Some very important fruits for the sport:</p>
              <p>Banana, a classic in sports nutrition, helps improve performance in sports and offers a good dose of fast energy and easy assimilation by the body. Its high mineral content and especially potassium helps regulate body fluids.</p>
              <p>Grapes, for their high content of antioxidants to prevent oxidative stress that increases free radicals.</p>
              <p>Citrus, for having vitamin C and being an important source of antioxidants
    The apple, because it has many vitamins and minerals, is easy to digest and is a food that fights fats since it costs more to consume than the calories it contains.</p>
              <p>Strawberries, because of their high mineral content, especially iron, helps maintain good blood levels, helping the muscles to oxygenate and obtain the nutrients it requires through the blood.</p>
              <p>Melon and watermelon, because of its high water content, to stay hydrated when needed.</p>
              <p>The carrot, although rather mineral, because it has vitamin A and carbohydrates, ideal to get the energy that is required in the sport.</p>
              <p>Avocado, for its important amount of essential fatty acids, for good cell function and against cholesterol.</p>
              <p>Papaya, good for feeding muscle fibers.</p>

              <p>On many occasions we have emphasized the importance of including vegetables in the diet, but now more than ever, if we want to get a muscle defined body, it is important that we take care of this type of food, because this way we will be able to feed Healthy while avoiding the intake of fats that in the end we end up covering. So in this post we are going to stop at the importance that vegetables have in the sports diet for several reasons.</p>
              <p>Vegetables can be a great ally in the sports diet for several reasons to keep in mind. Of course we must have them present, as they will be the perfect complement in our diet for any meal because of its versatility.</p>
              <p>First of all, it is important to keep in mind the nutritional value of vegetables. First of all they are an important source of minerals and vitamins that we need for the correct functioning of the organism. But to this must be added their low fat intake, since to contain fats will always be essential fatty acids like omega-3 or monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that the body needs to function properly.</p>
              <p>Its high fiber content makes them the perfect ally for any meal, especially to quench your appetite and avoid unnecessary food intake. But in addition the fiber is perfect to keep the organism in perfect condition eliminating the toxins and waste substances that are left over. That is why vegetables must accompany any main dish rich in protein, because this way we will be better fed and kill hunger faster without resorting to whims or foods less recommended.</p>
              <p>It is a good way to get added carbohydrate to the diet of a high nutritional value and in a healthy way. It should not be forgotten that vegetables, depending on the type, contain high concentrations of natural sugars that the body assimilates very well and therefore will help us to stay energized and to avoid catabolization. But without hardly taking the risk of gaining unnecessary body fat.</p>
              <p>Another point to keep in mind is that because they contain few calories, we can use high amounts to accompany them with proteins, so that they help us to satiate the appetite much better. Ideally, steamed vegetables should be prepared, although we can prepare them roasted, grilled, cooked and even raw. Either way it will be a healthy delicacy that will help us to be much better.</p>

            <div class="content-text">
              <p>The importance of feeding in any type of athlete is well known. Development, performance, speed, resistance .. These are just a few examples of what a different diet can do. However, if there is one type of food essential for the practice of sport is meat. What benefits do they bring us? What types of meat to eat?</p>
              <p>Muscles live and feed on food proteins, so for any athlete is hopelessly necessary a good protein diet.</p>
              <p>As we have said, the meat is rich in protein. However, each type of meat has a different level of protein as well as another distinct type of nutrients such as vitamins. For athletes, the type of meat that interests us are those with higher levels of protein, always with the lowest fat content possible. With these requirements we have two types of meat that stand out over the others: chicken and turkey.</p>
              <p>Therefore, varying between these three types of meals make us properly feed the muscles for their development, and also not to gain excess fat.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, we have the veal and the pork. Although they contribute a great amount of proteins, they sin to contain a great fat index, reason why it is less advisable for the athletes. However, and although it is preferable to use the three types of meat mentioned above, it is also necessary to say that from time to time it is advisable for health to change the type of meat that we eat, since each one of them contribute us different nutrients .</p>
              <p>In short, if you are an athlete try to have as essential food the meat in your diet, and varies the types of meat taking into account what we have discussed.</p>

              <p>Food is a key element when it comes to sports that can make your training successful or not. Therefore, you must know what you are looking for when you play sports and, depending on your objectives, select the most suitable food to achieve it. One of the most important foods for an athlete is fish.</p>
              <p>Although many people do not confess very loving of him, the truth is that brings great benefits to our health. And I love it, I will not fool you. Today I want to explain all the goodness of this delicious food.</p>
              <p>If you practice regular sports, especially some like running, you will know that the fish has to be a regular food in your diet to get good results. One of the substances that provides your body with fish are Omega 3 fatty acids. These help your body to combat the oxidation and inflammation that occur with the practice of sport, which will help prevent the appearance of injuries.</p>
              <p>Omega 3 is found primarily in blue fish, such as bonito, salmon or mackerel, although it also appears in some white fish, but in smaller amounts. If you consume blue fish in the right amounts, you will ensure a better functioning of your body and you will get a better result when practicing sport. You should eat fish at least twice a week to get the required amount of Omega 3.</p>
              <p>As you can imagine, the consumption of fish has not only beneficial effects for the practice of the sport. Anyone, whether habitual sportsman or not, must include the right amount of fish that allows him to have a healthy and balanced diet.</p>
              <p>Its effects on health are, for example, the prevention of heart disease, since Omega 3 fatty acids prevent the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries.</p>
              <p>Also, the amount of saturated fat that fish has in general is very low, so you can eat more than other foods with the same contribution of fat for your body. There are even studies that point out that it helps prevent or delay the onset of diseases that affect memory, such as Alzheimer's and dementia.</p>

              <p>What are carbohydrates?</p>
              <p>They are simple molecules that can form large or small molecules. When digested, they degrade to their simplest constituents so that they can be absorbed in the intestine and thus pass into the bloodstream.</p>
              <p>What foods are rich in carbohydrates?</p>
              <p>Carbohydrates are found mainly in bread, potatoes, pasta, rice and other cereals. Some foods made from cereals are also rich in these nutrients: breakfast cereals, cookies, pastries, etc. Fruit and dried legumes (such as beans) also provide significant amounts of carbohydrates.</p>
              <p>What is the importance of carbohydrates?</p>
              <p>To begin with, they are the body's main source of energy when performing physical exercise: the more intense it is, the more carbohydrates are needed. Thus, these nutrients have a fundamental role in the metabolism of energy. Being their main fuel, athletes should pay special attention to the amount and type of carbohydrates they consume.</p>
              <p>Muscle glycogen stores in the liver are limited to about 500 g, so it is important for the athlete to be very careful about what he or she eats before, during and after exercise, especially if it lasts for more than one hour and is intense High average. The amount, quality, and timing of carbohydrates can determine good or bad glycogen replenishment in muscles. These factors may be even more prevalent if breaks between workouts or competitions are short.</p>
              <p>Low carbohydrate consumption before and during training or competition makes energy reserves deplete more quickly, which favors the onset of fatigue, so a good carbohydrate replenishment is essential for the hour after Of having trained. This allows a faster recovery and more muscle and liver glycogen, which implies a better preparation for the next training. In this way, the performance will benefit.</p>
              <p>All athletes should routinely consume carbohydrate-rich foods (5 to 10 g / kg per day), up to 60% of the total daily caloric value of food. These recommendations are not usually fully achieved, but are necessary to maximize glycogen and energy reserves. The specific amount of carbohydrates each person should consume depends on the duration and intensity of the workouts.</p>
              <p>Choosing your diet, pay attention to the foods that contribute this nutrient, not as an accompaniment, but as the center of the meals.</p>

            <div class="content-text">
              <p>Fat, a word that many people only repel by listening to it, is that it is one of the main enemies when it comes to getting good health and fitness. In countless occasions we have emphasized in Vitónica the importance of consuming healthy fats to get the organism to go well. Despite this, many people continue to ignore fats in their diet, not knowing that they are totally necessary and that the body needs them, and more so when we play sports.</p>
              <p>Regarding fats, there are different catalogs and types, since we must differentiate between saturated, unsaturated and polyunsaturated. Saturated are the ones we should avoid, but the rest are necessary for a correct cellular functioning, and is that they are an important energy strong together with glycogen, which is the fastest way the body has to obtain the strength needed to cope To the activity.</p>
              <p>The process of obtaining energy has several phases, and is that the first thing that is consumed is glycogen, and then you take advantage of the fats we consume. It is important that we have adequate levels of fat to avoid consuming muscle tissues for energy. This is the main problem when leaving aside the fat, and is that when practicing physical activity the body requires a lot of energy and obtains it from the reserves it accumulates. If there is something happens that we do not want anyone, and that is the loss of muscle mass.</p>
              <p>If we get to this situation we will get a state of chronic fatigue, and is that when we lack fat, the body will have no place to get the energy, because the tissues are not consumed so quickly or are transformed into energy immediately. This situation will prevent us from performing a correct physical activity, because it makes us stay for a long time low energy and not want to face a training routine.</p>
              <p>To solve this it is necessary that we ingest fats in our food, but, yes, they have to be healthy, for that we must leave aside the saturated fatty acids that we can not use and that accumulate in the organism worsening our health on several levels, Because it means a worsening of the circulatory system in addition to worsening our physical appearance. If we use healthier fats, the body will transform them and take advantage of them to improve their condition.</p>
